               Teregowda): Differential Cryptanalysis is currently the most
               powerful tool available for analysing block ciphers, and new
               block ciphers need to be designed to resist it. It has been
               suggested that the use of S-boxes based on bent functions, with
               a at XOR profile, would be immune. However our studies of
               differential cryptanalysis, particularly applied to the LOKI
               cipher, have shown that this is not the case. In fact, this
               results in a relatively easily broken scheme. We show that an
               XOR pro le with carefully placed zeroes is required. We also
               show that in order to avoid some variant forms of differential
               cryptanalysis, permutation P needs to be chosen to prevent easy
               propagation of a constant XOR value back into the same S-box. We
               redesign the LOKI cipher to form LOKI91, to illustrate these
               results, as well as to correct the key schedule to remove the
               formation of equivalent keys. We conclude with an overview of
               the security of the new cipher.",
